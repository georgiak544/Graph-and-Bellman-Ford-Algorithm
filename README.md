# 🔗 Graph Visualization & Operations (C++)

A C++ application for representing and interacting with graph structures. The program provides core graph functionality (nodes, edges, traversal) and integrates a graphical interface for visualization and user interaction.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 Graph data structure implementation (adjacency list or matrix)
- ➕ Add/remove nodes and edges dynamically
- 🔁 Traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS, etc.)
- 🧠 Pathfinding or search (e.g. Dijkstra, A*)
- 🖼️ Graphical User Interface (via custom `GraphUI` module)
- 🖱️ Interactive input from the user (keyboard/mouse support)

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Graph theory**: Nodes, edges, connectivity, paths
- **Data structures**: Lists, sets, and maps
- **OOP in C++**: Modular code in `Graph.hpp`, `GraphUI.hpp`
- **Event-driven programming** (if GUI-based)
- **Separation of logic and presentation**
